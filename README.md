# Intro
POSH.TV is a Windows PowerShell-based IRC client for Twitch.tv. This was created utilizing PowerShell 7.0 in mind, but should still work with PowerShell 6.0. Personally, PowerShell is my favorite scripting language and is something I learned a lot of while working as a Cybersecurity Analyst. It is always interesting to figure out how to do something, and it is always fun to come across something that makes things simpler (or, in some cases, make days of work pointless because you went about it the wrong way).

# Why PowerShell?
Most Twitch.tv bots utilize one or several languages, including Java, Python, C++, Ruby, or so on; there was a Github project called [pwshbot](https://github.com/fourtf/pwshbot/) that was working on creating their own PowerShell Twitch.tv client, but hadn't been updated in several months. Using what they had as a base, it was converted into a newer soft-coded format for anyone to use! Additionally, it is a fun project!
