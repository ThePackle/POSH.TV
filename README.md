# Intro
POSH.TV is a Windows PowerShell-based IRC client for Twitch.tv. This was created utilizing PowerShell 7.0 in mind, but should still work with PowerShell 6.0.

# Why PowerShell?
Most Twitch.tv bots utilize one or several languages, including Java, Python, C++, Ruby,or so on; there was a Github link to a user (INPUT) that was working on creating their own PowerShell Twitch.tv client, but hadn't been updated in several months. Using what they had as a base, it was converted into a newer soft-coded format for anyone to use!
